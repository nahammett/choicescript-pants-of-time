You wake up drowsy, as with every morning. By instinct you arise and start your
morning routine. You look in the mirror. You note the same features you've seen
since you were a teenager, you are ...

What is your name?

*input_text name

You put on your Evil Corp nametag (it says $!{name}) and head to work.

You have worked at Evil Corp for a few months, since you left your last job.

As you swipe your ID card to enter the building, you are stopped by your
forgettable co-worker.

"Hey $!{name}! Hold the door!"

You try desperately to remember his name. You catch a glimpse at his nametag
which says ...

*input_text friend_name

"Oh, hi $!{friend_name}," you respond, trying to mask your lack of enthusiasm.

"Are you excited for the new prototype test today? There's a lot riding on the
results," he says.

  #What test?
    *set kindness %+10
    "What test?" you ask, perplexed.

    "Oh, I had thought it was big news throughout the company. Some of the
    higher-ups are testing a groundbreaking new technology today, they say
    it'll change the world."

    *goto after

  #Of course I am.
    *set kindness %-10
    "What test?" you ask, perplexed.
    "Of course I am," you say, walking quickly and hoping $!{friend_name}
    won't try so hard to catch up.

    "Me too!" he responds enthusiastically, matching your pace effortlessly.
